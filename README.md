<h2>Task: Create Repository</h2>
<body>
<ol>
  <li>Install Webstorm through (Jetbrains: https://www.jetbrains.com)</li>
  <li>Install Git as a local program on your computer (Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads)</li>
  <li>Setup a GitHub account if you haven't already, if not click here: (https://github.com/join)</li>
  <li>Connect GitHub to webstorm by pressing (Ctrl+Alt+S) to bring up system preferences.</li>
  <li>Navigate to Version Control on the list on the left when system preferences is opened and click Git.</li>
  <li>In "Path to Git executable" direct that to the place you installed Git in step 2.</li>
  <li>While still in system preferences scroll back to the left scroll list and click Appearances and Behavior > System Settings > Passwords.</li>
  <li>Choose a location to save your database password file and assign a password.</li>
  <li>For this step navigate back to GitHub and go to your profile, from there you should be able to click the + sign in the upper right hand corner and click "New Repository".</li>
  <li>You are able to create a repository in Webstorm by Selecting Import Version Control > Create Git Repository then just give it a name.</li>
  <li>Conversely this works both ways as you can also download a repository from Github to your local machine by clicking File > New > Project from Version Control. In the URL field type in the link to the repository and add .git to the end and where you want to save it in the Directory field. If there is no conflict of names or files existing in the desired location it will save it locally.</li>
  <li>Now that everything is configured you can create a file by clicking File >  New then scrolling down to your choice of file typically a Stylesheet or HTML file.</li>
  <li>While you are working on your file whenever you need your version history saved or you would like to save your project after completing a part of it you can commit which also allows you to provide a comment of what was changed/edited.</li>
  <li>When you feel confident everything is finished and ready to be shown off you can press the push button and upload your file to GitHub, or merge it if there is already existing data.</li>
  <li>You can now see the file you just worked on and pushed on GitHub!</li>
</ol>

<!-- Creates an unorganized list, with proper formatting -->
<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Branch</strong> - Allows for experimenting with a bug fix or new feature in a safe environment that can't impact the main branch if things so wrong. Must be attached in some way to the original main branch.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Clone</strong> - Cloning allows you to clone a repository from GitHub and save it locally.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Commit</strong> - A commit saves all the changes to all files being committed in the branch.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Fetch</strong> - A safer version of pull where u can download data from a remote repository without it attempting to merge or replace any data.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>GIT</strong> - Version Control System that helps with keeping track of code history and different branches and is installed locally.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>GitHub</strong> - Can do everything that Git can do but it also as the added benefit of being able to collaborate live with people.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Merge</strong> - Allows you to combine the code of multiple branches into one singular branch.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Merge Conflict</strong> - Merge conflicts happen when different branches are trying to merge into one but there is a conflict of information on the same line in any given file.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Push</strong> - When you try to upload a repository on a local system to GitHub's online repository.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Pull</strong> - The opposite of pushing content from local to GitHub pull will take the repository from GitHub and install it locally given there are no conflicts of file names.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Remote</strong> - A repository that's hosted on the internet rather than locally.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Repository</strong> - A folder hosted either locally or remotely that tracks changes to your file history in that specific project.</p></li>
</ul>
