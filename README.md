<h3>Task: Create Repository</h3>

<!-- Creates an unorganized list, with proper formatting -->
<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Branch</strong> - Allows for experimenting with a bug fix or new feature in a safe environment that can't impact the main branch if things so wrong. Must be attached in some way to the original main branch.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Clone</strong> - Cloning allows you to clone a repository from GitHub and save it locally.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Commit</strong> - A commit saves all the changes to all files being committed in the branch.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Fetch</strong> - A safer version of pull where u can download data from a remote repository without it attempting to merge or replace any data.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>GIT</strong> - Version Control System that helps with keeping track of code history and different branches and is installed locally.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>GitHub</strong> - Can do everything that Git can do but it also as the added benefit of being able to collaborate live with people.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Merge</strong> - Allows you to combine the code of multiple branches into one singular branch.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Merge Conflict</strong> - Merge conflicts happen when different branches are trying to merge into one but there is a conflict of information on the same line in any given file.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Push</strong> - When you try to upload a repository on a local system to GitHub's online repository.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Pull</strong> - The opposite of pushing content from local to GitHub pull will take the repository from GitHub and install it locally given there are no conflicts of file names.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Remote</strong> - A repository that's hosted on the internet rather than locally.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Repository</strong> - A folder hosted either locally or remotely that tracks changes to your file history in that specific project.</p></li>
</ul>
